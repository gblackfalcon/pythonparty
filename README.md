Bill Withers - "Use Me"

My friends
Feel it's their appointed duty
They keep tryin' to tell me
All you want to do is use me
Ah-huh, but my answer (Ah-huh)
Yeah to all that use me stuff

I, I, I, I
Yes, I wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you just keep on usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

My brother
Sit me right down and he talked to me
He told me
That I ought not to let you just walk on me
And I'm sure he meant well
Yeah, but when our talk was through

I, I, I said brother if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Ah-huh, sometimes
It's true you really do abuse me
Ah, you get me crowd of high class people
And then you act real rude to me
Ah-huh, but oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you love me I can't get enough

Ah-huh and I wanna spread the news
That it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you just keep on usin' me
Until you use me up
Ah, until you use me up

Talkin' 'bout you usin' people
It all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're usin' me
'Cause I sure am usin' you to do the things that you do
Ah-huh, to do the things that you do
